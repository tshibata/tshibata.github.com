<h1>4. Bond</h1>
Now the score is shown not only by numbers but also by lights defined as <a href="On.ss.xml">On.ss.xml</a> and <a href="Off.ss.xml">Off.ss.xml</a>.
To show them, <a href="Score.ss.xml">Score.ss.xml</a> has &lt;g&gt; elements, i.e. SVG groups, with &lt;ss:bond name="Lost"/&gt; and &lt;ss:bond name="Got"/&gt;.
Graft given by Score() has properties named "Lost" and "Got" to refer these elements.
In <a href="airhockey.js">airhockey.js</a>, they are score.Lost and score.Got.
Stasc bond gives you reference to the dom object.
So you can use it with any dom API such as appendChild().

<div>
Stasc bond has getter but not setter.
If you need to set element, you have to use stasc plug, which is introduced in the next page.
