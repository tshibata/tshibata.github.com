<h1>5. Plug</h1>
You can't change value of stasc bond.
If you need to change, you have to use stasc plug like <a href="Table.ss.xml">Table.ss.xml</a>.
</div>
<div>
Inside the stasc plug tag, there must be only one element tree.
The element tree is another graft and stasc tags inside belong to it.
For example, a stasc tag Z in a stasc plug Y which belongs to graft X is referred as X.Y.Z.
Z can't belong directly to X because it is gone with Y when Y is replaced.

<div>
In case of this air hockey game, title of the game is shown until you click "Start" below the title. Then click() in <a href="airhockey.js">airhockey.js</a> is called and the title is replaced with <a href="Clear.ss.xml">Clear.ss.xml</a>, which shows actually nothing as overlay. It shows <a href="Score.ss.xml">Score.ss.xml</a> when the puck is in a goal. When the game is over, it shows <a href="End.ss.xml">End.ss.xml</a>. You can play again by clicking "Replay".

<h2>Well-mannered and Ill-mannered</h2>
I recomend you to use stasc tags in following way:
<div style="display:table; padding:1em;">
Use attribute and property to set or get these values.<br/>
Use bond to add grafts or to remove added grafts.<br/>
Use plug to switch grafts.<br/>
</div>
Bond and plug are DOM objects.
So technically you can do anything what you can do with a DOM object.
But plug supposes it has only one child node which is there from the beginning or replaced by using the plug.
