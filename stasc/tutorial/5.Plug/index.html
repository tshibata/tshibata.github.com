<h1>5. Plug</h1>
You can't change value of stasc bond.
If you need to change, you have to use stasc plug like <a href="Table.ss.xml">Table.ss.xml</a>.
</div>
<div>
Inside the stasc plug tag, there must be only one element tree.
And the element tree must not have any stasc tag in it because it will be replaced.
The element tree is just provisional.

In case of this air hockey game, title of the game is shown until you click "Start" below the title. Then click() in <a href="airhockey.js">airhockey.js</a> is called and the title is replaced with <a href="Clear.ss.xml">Clear.ss.xml</a>, which shows actually nothing as overlay. It shows <a href="Score.ss.xml">Score.ss.xml</a> when the puck is in a goal. When the game is over, it shows <a href="End.ss.xml">End.ss.xml</a>. You can play again by clicking "Replay".
