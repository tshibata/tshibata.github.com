<h1>2.1. Math</h1>
One more Mallet and a Puck are newly added into <a href="Table.ss.xml">Table.ss.xml</a>.
But nothing is really new.
Although <a href="airhockey.js">airhockey.js</a> is much more complicated, it is not interesting at all as tutorial of stasc.
Just some black magics are brought from textbook of highschool math.
You can go ahead right now, or after playing.
Yes, now you can play.
